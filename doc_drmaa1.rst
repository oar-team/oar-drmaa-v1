:Abstract: This document describes installation, configuration and usage
  of DRMAA for OAR_, which is based on `DRMAA for Torque/PBS Pro`_ library (PBS DRMAA for short).


.. contents::

Introduction
============

DRMAA for OAR is an implementation of `Open Grid Forum`_ DRMAA_
(Distributed Resource Management Application API) specification_ (version 1) for
submission and control jobs to OAR_ resources and tasks management system (also known as *batch scheduler*).  

Using DRMAA, grid applications builders, portal developers
and ISVs can use the same high-level API to link their software with
different cluster/resource management systems.

**This implemtation is based on** `DRMAA for Torque/PBS Pro`_ library developed by `FedStage Computing`_ and `Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center`_.

Installation
============

The required librairies to compilation are following:
  * json-glib (version **0.12 or higher**)
  * libcurl
  * glib 2.0
  
Other required tools are :
 * GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool),
 * GUN m4 macro processeur
 * gperf perfect hash function generator,
  
All these requirements are availble in major GNU/Linux distribution. 

For ``Debian``::

  $ apt-get install libjson-glib-dev libcurl3 

For ``Centos``::

  $ yum install glib2 glib2-devel  libcurl libcurl-devel json-glib json-glib-devel

Note for ``Centos 6.5`` json-glib package can be found at: https://github.com/project-hatohol/json-glib-for-distribution/blob/master/RPMS/x86_64/

To compile the library just go to main source directory and type::

  $ ./configure [--prefix=/installation/directory] && make
  $ make install


Configuration
=============

This librairy exploits the `OAR Restful API`_ to communicate with OAR core system. The machine where DRMAA is used must have access to the API server (see `OAR Restful API`_ documentation for the Apache configuration). By default the location of the API is ``http://localhost/oarapi``. It can be changed by using the ``OAR_API_SERVER_URL`` environment variable.  


During DRMAA session initialization (``drmaa_init``) the library tries to read
its configuration parameters from the following locations:
``/etc/oar_drmaa.conf``, ``~/.oar_drmaa.conf`` and from file given in the
``OAR_DRMAA_CONF`` environment variable.
If multiple configuration sources are present then all configurations
are merged with values from user-defined files taking precedence
(in following order: ``$OAR_DRMAA_CONF``, ``~/.oar_drmaa.conf``,
``/etc/oar_drmaa.conf``).

Currently recognized configuration parameters are:

  pool_delay
    Amount of time (in seconds) between successive checks of unfinished job(s).

     Type: integer, Default: 5

  wait_thread
    Value 1 enables single "wait thread" for updating jobs status. 
     
     Type: integer, Default: 0
     
  job_categories
    Dictionary of job categories.  It's keys are job categories names
    mapped to `native specification` strings.  Attributes set by
    job category can be overridden by corresponding DRMAA attributes
    or native specification.  Special category name ``default``
    is used when ``drmaa_job_category`` job attribute was not set.

  cache_job_state
    According to the DRMAA specification every `drmaa_job_ps()` call should
    query DRM system for job state.  With this option one may optimize
    communication with DRM.  If set to positive integer `drmaa_job_ps()`
    returns remembered job state without communicating with DRM for
    `cache_job_state` seconds since last update.  By default library
    conforms to specification (no caching will be performed).

    Type: integer, default: 0

  Different modes of operation

  =========== ======== ======================= ===================================
  wait_thread   mode    keep_completed needed         comments
  =========== ======== ======================= ===================================
       0       polling           yes              default configuration
       1       polling           yes              more effective than above
  =========== ======== ======================= ===================================
  

Configuration file syntax
-------------------------

Configuration file is in form a dictionary.
Dictionary is set of zero or more key-value pairs.
Key is a string while value could be a string, an integer
or another dictionary.
::

  configuration: dictionary | dictionary_body
  dictionary: '{' dictionary_body '}'
  dictionary_body: (string ':' value ',')*
  value: integer | string | dictionary
  string: unquoted-string | single-quoted-string | double-quoted-string
  unquoted-string: [^ \t\n\r:,0-9][^ \t\n\r:,]*
  single-quoted-string: '[^']*'
  double-quoted-string: "[^"]*"
  integer: [0-9]+

Configuration file example
--------------------------

::
  
  # oar_drmaa.conf - Sample pbs_drmaa configuration file.
  
  wait_thread: 0,

  #pool_delay: 5,

  job_categories: {
	#default: "-q default", # 
	be: "-t besteffort",
	#test: "-N test -q testing",
  },
  

DRMAA attributes support and Native Specification
==================================================

DRMAA for OAR support main DRMAA attributes at the exception of `drmaa_start_time`  and `drmaa_block_email`.
There are not currently planned in the OAR roadmap if you need them please contact the developers. 

DRMAA interface allows to pass DRM dependant job submission options.
Those options may be specified by settings ``drmaa_native_specification`` and corresponds to `oarsub` 
command (the submission CLI tool). Note that all `oarsub` options are not available (see table below). 
For detailed description of each option see OAR documentation. Also note that all DRMAA attributes have not direct equivalent in `oarsub` options but remains. 

Attributes set in native specification overrides corresponding DRMAA job attributes.

  ========================== ========================================================

Test-suite
==========

The DRMAA for OAR library was successfully tested with OAR_ 2.5.3 and 2.5.4 on Debian and Centos.  Following
table presents results of tests from `Official DRMAA test-suite`_ (originally developed for Sun Grid Engine).

Note, the test with Suspending/Resuming job test requires the ``USERS_ALLOWED_HOLD_RESUME="yes"`` is set on frontend's  OAR configuration file (`oar.conf`).

Known bugs and limitations
==========================

 * Job termination (when job is running) is realized by PBS
   by sending SIGTERM and/or SIGKILL therefore retrieving
   those signals cannot be distinguished from abort using
   ``drmaa_control(DRMAA_CONTROL_TERMINATE)``.  Then job termination
   state is marked as "aborted" and "signaled" whatever is the state.

 * ``drmaa_wcoredump()`` always returns ``false``.

 * Waiting functions (``drmaa_wait()`` and ``drmaa_synchronize()``)
   must pool DRM to find out whether job finished.


Release notes
=============

 * 1.0.1 support for 1.0.2 oarapi version and use pbs-drmaa-1.0.17 as intermediate library.
 * 1.0.0 first release 

Developers
==========

This library is based on `DRMAA for Torque/PBS Pro`_ and the core functionality of DRMAA is put into ``drmaa_utils`` library. `OAR`_ exploits the `OAR Restful API`_.

Developer tools
---------------
Although not needed for library user the following tools may be required
if you intend to develop DRMAA library for OAR or run tests:

 * GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, m4),
 * gperf_ perfect hash function generator,
 * glib
 * curl
 * glib_json

To initialize OAR DRMAA source files from OAR git repositoty, go to ``sources/extra/oar-drmaa`` directory, launch ``./extract_from_pbs-drmaa_tgz.sh`` followed by  ``./autogen.sh``. To clean source files execute ``make clean`` and ``./extract_from_pbs-drmaa_tgz.sh rm``.
